## 2\. Fast Startup

### 2.1 Preparation Before Startup

The OK-MA35-S21 development board has two system login methods, serial and network login. Hardware preparation before system startup:

+ 12V2A or 12V3A DC Power Cable

+ Debugging serial cable

+ Network cable (for network login)

+ Check the activation mode of the DIP switch
  

Please check the DIP switch on your development board to ensure it is set to the desired boot mode. The debug serial port on the development board is a Type-C socket, allowing users to connect the development board to a PC using a USB to Type-C cable to monitor the status of the development board.

### 2.2 Serial Port Login

#### 2.2.1 Serial Port Connection Settings

**Description:**

**Serial port terminal login user: serial port terminal automatically logs in (user: root, password root).**

**Serial port settings: Baud rate 115200, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit, no flow control.**

**Hardware Requirements: Type-C cable required to connect PC and development boards**

**Software requirements: PC Windows system needs to install the super terminal software. Because the terminal software has many types, users can choose their familiar one.**

In the following, we take the putty terminal software as an example to introduce the serial port login method:

**Step 1:** Connect the serial port number of the computer---check the serial port number from the device manager (Based on the port actually recognized by the computer ). SERIAL-A is the A-core debug serial port, and SERIAL-B is the M-core debug serial port.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790809202_51ee503e_e5ab_4f2c_a1e2_5b02b7ebf2b3.png)

**Step 2:** Open and set up putty, then set the serial line according to the COM port of the computer used, baud rate 115200

#### 2.3.2 FTP

OK-MA35-S21 development board supports FTP service and automatically starts when powered on. Once you‚Äôve set the IP address, it can be used as an FTP server. The following describes how to utilize the FTP tool for file transfer.

Path: OK-MA35-S21 Linux5.10.140+Qt5.12.8\_User‚Äôs Profile\\3-Too\\FileZilla

1\. Execute the following command on the development board;

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# mkdir -p /usr/share/empty          // Create the 'empty' directory
root@OKMA35-S2/# chown root:root /usr/share/empty       // Set the owner and group of this directory to 'root'
root@OKMA35-S2/# chmod 755 /usr/share/empty         // Set the usage permissions
root@OKMA35-S2/# ifconfig eth0 172.20.0.143          // Configure the IP according to your own network situation
```

2\. Install the FileZilla tool on Windows and set it up as shown in the figure below.

**Note: This function requires the development board to be connected to the network cable; the host IP is set in the same network segment as the client, ensuring that the host and the client are in the same LAN; username root, password root; after successful login, you can upload, download and delete files anywhere in the file system.**

Test with the development board IP 172.20.0.143. Please modify the development board IP according to the actual situation.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790809768_7fdceba2_c1f0_4cd2_9d72_8b0eb5b73ff7.png)

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790809836_ab3b91e5_2379_4f0d_a15e_34e38fa41fab.png)

3\. Once connected successfully, you can perform upload and download operations.

### 2.4 System Shutdown

In general, the power can be turned off directly. If there is data storage, function use, or other operations, avoid turning off the power arbitrarily during operation to prevent irreversible damage to the file. In such cases, only re-flashing the firmware can resolve the issue. To ensure that data is not completely written, enter the sync command to complete data synchronization before turning off the power.

**Note: If the product designed by the user based on the core board has an abnormal system shutdown due to an accidental power loss in use, measures such as power-down protection can be incorporated into the design.**

#### 3.2.5 QSPI Test

**Note: If the system has been modified to use FLASH-NOR to boot the system, do not do the following test operation, otherwise the uboot in FLASH-NOR will be damaged.**

The OK-MA35-S21 is externally connected to the FLASH-NOR storage device through the QSPI, and the interface function is verified by mounting the read-write device.

1\. Check if a QSPI device exists in the system mtd.

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# cat /proc/mtd
dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 01000000 00001000 "spi0.0"
```

2\. Use the dd command to write a test of the FLASH-NOR interface speed:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mtdblock0 bs=1M count=10
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
10485760 bytes (10 MB, 10 MiB) copied, 135.098 s, 77.6 kB/s
```

3\. Use the dd command for the FLASH-NOR interface speed read test:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# dd if=/dev/mtdblock0 of=/dev/null bs=1M count=10
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
10485760 bytes (10 MB, 10 MiB) copied, 2.97665 s, 3.5 MB/s
```

#### 3.2.6 Watchdog Test

Watchdog is a function often used in embedded systems. The device node of watchdog in OK-MA35-S21 is/dev/watchdog. This test provides two test procedures, and the user can choose one of them to test according to the actual situation.

Start fltest\_watchdog, set the timeout to 8 seconds, and regularly feed the watchdog.

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# fltest_watchdog
Watchdog Ticking Away!
```

This command turns on the watchdog and performs a feed, so the system does not reboot.

**Note: When ctrl + C is used to end the test program, the system will reset after 8 seconds. If you do not want to reset, please input within 10 seconds after ctrl + C:**

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# fltest_watchdog -d
Watchdog card disabled.  //Turn off the watchdog
```

Start fltest\_watchdogrestart, set the reset time to 8s without feeding the dog.

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# fltest_watchdogrestart
Restart after 8 seconds
```

This command turns on the watchdog, but does not feed the dog, and the system reboots after 8 seconds.

#### 3.2.7 WIFI Test

The OK-MA35-S21 supports the onboard 8723du by default and supports STA and AP modes

##### 3.2.7.1 STA Mode

Before using the wifi function, the following steps are required for configuration:

Step 1:

Assume that the SSID name of the Wifi hotspot is ChinaNet-Jvgv and the password is asdasd123

Enter the following command in the development board terminal:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# fltest_wifi.sh -i wlan0 -s "ChinaNet-Jvgv" -p asdasd123
```

In the above command,

-i wlan0, the specific node corresponding to each module should be determined before use, depending on the actual situation.

-s The actual wifi hotspot name of the connection;

-pÔºöfollowed by the parameter Password refers to the password of the actual wifi hotspot to be connected. If the current hotspot does not have a password, the parameter after -p is NONE.

Step 2:

Check whether it can ping the external network and enter the following command in the terminal:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# ping www.forlinx.com
PING www.forlinx.com (211.149.226.120): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 211.149.226.120: seq=0 ttl=55 time=39.591 ms
64 bytes from 211.149.226.120: seq=1 ttl=55 time=37.263 ms
64 bytes from 211.149.226.120: seq=2 ttl=55 time=37.496 ms
```

If you want to stop, you need to press Ctrl + C to ping, indicating that the network can be used normally at this time.

##### 3.2.7.2 AP Mode

Before using the hotspot function, you need to connect and configure the network interface to ensure it has Internet access (refer to section 3.2.14 on Ethernet configuration for setup). Configure the hotspot command. The command AP becomes DISABLED in the first pass, and becomes ENABLE in the second pass, as shown below:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# fltest_hostapd.sh
killall: hostapd: no process killed
Stopping dnsmasq: FAIL
Starting dnsmasq: OK
Configuration file: /etc/hostapd-2.4g.conf
root@OKMA35-S2/# rfkill: Cannot open RFKILL control device
Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 98:03:cf:65:2b:d5 and ssid "OKMA35_WIFI_2.4G_AP"
wlan0: interface[   29.829977] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): wlan0: link becomes ready
 state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED
```

WiFi Hotspot Name: OKMA35\_WIFI\_2.4G\_AP

Password: 12345678

At this point, the phone can connect to the hotspot and access the internet normally.

#### 3.2.8 Bluetooth Test

#### 3.2.9 RTC Function Test

RTC testing is mainly done by using the date and hwclock tools to set the software and hardware time. The test checks if the software clock can read and synchronize with the RTC clock when the development board is powered off and on again (Note: Make sure that the button battery is already installed on the board).

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# date -s "2024-5-23 10:50:00"		// Set the time
Thu May 23 10:50:00 UTC 2024 
root@OKMA35-S2/# date								// Read the time
Thu May 23 10:50:25 UTC 2024 
root@OKMA35-S2/# hwclock -w -u				        // Calculate the time zone based on the system time and write it to the RTC
root@OKMA35-S2/# hwclock -r				        	// Check the hardware time
Thu May 23 10:50:46 2024  0.000000 seconds 
// Restart the development board. After entering the system, read the system time to check if it is the same as the set time
root@OKMA35-S2/# date                             // Read the time to verify if it is synchronized    
Thu May 23 10:51:40 UTC 2024
```

#### 3.2.18 CAN Test

The OK-MA35-S21 platform has four CAN bus interfaces: CAN0, CAN1, CAN2, and CAN3. The CAN wiring method is as follows: Connection of the H terminal of CAN to other CAN devices; connection of the L terminal of CAN to other CAN devices.

Using CAN0 and CAN1 as an example, short-connect CAN0 and CAN1, then execute the following commands in the development board terminal:

Set CAN0/CAN1 to 500K baud rate.

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# ifconfig can0 down
root@OKMA35-S2/# ifconfig can1 down
root@OKMA35-S2/# ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 
root@OKMA35-S2/# ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000 
root@OKMA35-S2/# ifconfig can0 up
root@OKMA35-S2/# ifconfig can1 up
```

The can0 device acts as a server (the server first executes the following command).

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/#  candump can0 &
```

can1 device as a client (client sends data)

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# cansend can1 123#1122334aabbccd			\\Send standard frame
can0  123   [7]  11 22 33 4A AB BC CD
root@OKMA35-S2/# cansend can1 00895441#1122334aabbccd		\\Send extended frame

```

2\. Change the blue LED to heartbeat lights

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/gpio_leds_test/leds/LED0# echo heartbeat > trigger
```

#### 3.2.20 SQLite3 Test

SQLite3 is a lightweight database that is ACID compliant relational database management system with low resource usage. OK-MA35-S21 development board is ported with version 3.34.1 of sqlit3.

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# sqlite3
SQLite version 3.34.1 2021-01-20 14:10:07
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite> create table tbl1 (one varchar(10), two smallint);       // Create table tbl1

sqlite> insert into tbl1 values('goodbye', 20);  // Insert data 'goodbye|20' into table tbl1
sqlite> select * from tbl1;                                // Query the contents of table tbl1
hello!|10
goodbye|20
sqlite> delete from tbl1 where one = 'hello!';                     // Delete data
sqlite> select * from tbl1;                                // Query the contents of table tbl1
goodbye|20
sqlite> .quit			                          // Exit the database (or use the .exit command)
```

#### 3.2.21 GPIO Test

OK-MA35-S21 development board provides a GPIO interface:

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790814357_608ee8b4_aa9e_4c7e_af03_4aee1848a902.png)

GPIO can be controlled in the application layer through sysfs to set the output level of GPIO. 

The corresponding number in sysfs of GPIO is:

| GPIO Group | Corresponding group number | Sysfs no. |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| A          | 0                          | 0         |
| B          | 1                          | 16        |
| C          | 2                          | 32        |
| D          | 3                          | 48        |
| E          | 4                          | 64        |
| F          | 5                          | 80        |
| ‚Ä¶          | ‚Ä¶                          | ‚Ä¶         |

The calculation formula is: corresponding group number \_ 16 + label, for example, PC1 = 2 \_ 16 + 1 = 33.

Take PA4 as an example for control, the pin number corresponding to PA4 is pin 4 of P35 terminal, and PA4 is GPIO 4 of Group A GPIO.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790814436_dfd43f0c_c803_46e5_abbe_8da8f5a9882e.png)

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# cd /sys/class/gpio/  
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/class/gpio# echo 4 > export   // Enable PA4
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/class/gpio# echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/direction   // Set the GPIO direction
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/class/gpio# echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value  // Set the output to high
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/class/gpio# echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value  // Set the output to low
```

During the test, a multimeter can be used to measure the PA4 pin to determine whether the output is normal.

#### 3.2.22 PWM Test

OK-MA35-S21 development board provides a 5 x PWM interface and a buzzer controlled by PWM:

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790814502_4ea74873_d77d_4ec6_8cb2_e984f99fd893.png)

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790814578_38279eb8_14a5_4e4d_bb7c_3f6d74f55015.png)

EPWM0 path is /sys/devices/platform/40580000.epwm0/pwm/pwmchip0Ôºõ

EPWM1 path is /sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6„ÄÇ

Taking the buzzer as an example, it is controlled by EPWM1 \_ CH2:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# cd /sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6/
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6# echo 2 > export // Enable CH2
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6# cd pwm2
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2# echo 100000 > period  // Set the period
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2# echo 50000 > duty_cycle // Set the duty cycle
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2# echo 'normal' > polarity  // Set the polarity
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2# echo 1 > enable   // Turn on the PWM output
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40590000.epwm1/pwm/pwmchip6/pwm2# echo 0 > enable   // Turn off the PWM output
```

#### 3.2.23 ADC Test

OK-MA35-S21 development board provides 8 x EADC and 8 x ADC with a voltage sampling range of 0~3.3V.

EADC0 path is /sys/devices/platform/40430000.eadc0/iio:device1Ôºå

The path of ADC0 is/sys/devices/platform/40420000.adc/iio: device0, where the in \_ voltage \* \_ raw is the sample value of the corresponding channel, 0 indicates 0 V, and 4095 indicates 3.3 V.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790814650_3adcf59c_e1ee_44c6_878a_45b5a07902ba.png)

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790814714_f5eb4541_963b_478a_8dfa_6d312e771479.png)

EADC0\_CH7 and ADC0\_CH2 measure the voltage of the sliding potentiometer on the test board. By adjusting the resistance value of the corresponding sliding potentiometer, you can observe whether the sampling values of the two channels change. Take ADC0\_CH2 as an example:

```plain
root@OKMA35-S2/# cd /sys/devices/platform/40420000.adc/iio:device0
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40420000.adc/iio:device0# cat in_voltage2_raw
2019
//Read the value of CH2 again after rotating the slide rheostat of R33 clockwise
root@OKMA35-S2/sys/devices/platform/40420000.adc/iio:device0# cat in_voltage2_raw
2208
```

#### 5.1.3 USB Step-by-step Flashing Test

During the development, performing a full flash every time is very time-consuming. Therefore, this section introduces the method of using the NuWriter flashing tool for individual flashing. The following image shows the compiled output folder: buildroot/output/images.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790818214_9096b5d2_c4db_49d8_a534_206bd4b8405c.png)

To demonstrate the flashing method, perform an individual flash of the kernel.

Connect the development board to the host using a Type-C cable. All steps are the same as full flashing except for the final step. The offsets for each part are shown in the diagram below.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790818329_96015956_448d_46a6_9574_e859fc9eb354.png)

The red box highlights the kernel, and its offset is 0x300000. Remember this number, as it will be used later.

After attaching the board, follow the steps shown in the diagram to individually replace the kernel.

forlinx@ubuntu:~$ cd en-us--MA35_SWriter_V1.03/MA35D1_NuWriter-master/
```

2\. Modify the content of the 15th line in pack.json according to the memory size, and change it to the corresponding memory size:

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu:~/en-us--MA35_SWriter_V1.03/MA35D1_NuWriter-master$ vi pack.json
```

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_Linux5_10_140_User_Manual/1733790818531_90873545_f3e6_4108_8a47_0892e0c8a450.png)

For 1GB of memory, change the 15th line to: "file": "./ddrimg/MA35D16A087C\_NonMCP\_WBDDR3L\_1GB.bin".

For 512MB of memory, change the 15th line to: "file": "./ddrimg/MA35D16A087C\_NonMCP\_WBDDR3L\_512MB.bin".

3\. Modify the content of the 23rd line in header.json according to the memory size:

For 1GB of memory, change the 23rd line to: "file": "./ddrimg/MA35D16A087C\_NonMCP\_WBDDR3L\_1GB.bin".

For 512MB of memory, change the 23rd line to: "file": "./ddrimg/MA35D16A087C\_NonMCP\_WBDDR3L\_512MB.bin".
