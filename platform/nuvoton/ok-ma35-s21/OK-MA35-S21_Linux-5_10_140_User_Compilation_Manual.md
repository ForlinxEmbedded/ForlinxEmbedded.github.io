## Overview

This manual is designed to enable users of the Forlinx Embedded development board to quickly understand the compilation process of the products and familiarize themselves with the compilation methods of Forlinx products. The application program needs to be cross-compiled on the Linux operating system before it can run on the development board. According to the method in the compilation manual, users can compile their own software code through practical operation.

The manual will provide instructions for setting up the environment but there may be some unforeseen issues during the environment setup process. For beginners, it is recommended to use the pre-configured development environment provided by us. This will allow you to quickly get started and reduce development time.

Linux systems are typically installed in three ways: dual system on a real machine, single system on a real machine, and virtual machine. Different installation methods have their advantages and disadvantages. This manual only provides methods to build ubuntu in a virtual machine. Computer hardware requirements: It is recommended to have at least 6GB of memory or more, so that you can allocate some memory to run the virtual machine (the virtual machine is recommended to have more than 2GB) and still do other operations on Windows, otherwise it will affect the performance of Windows.

The manual is mainly divided into four chapters:

+ Chapter 1. is mainly about the installation of VMware, and the version used is VMware¬Æ Workstation 15 Pro15.1.0. Users need to install VMware before using the ubuntu development environment.

+ Chapter 2. mainly introduces the method of loading the ubuntu development environment provided by Forlinx, and the development environment is 64-bit ubuntu20.04.

+ Chapter 3. mainly introduces the method of building a new ubuntu development environment. It takes 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 as an example to describe the creation process of Ubuntu. Due to different computer configurations, unexpected problems may arise during the setup process. It is recommended for beginners to use the environment that we have set up directly.

+ Chapter 4. mainly introduces the methods of compiling the source code related to the development board.

## 2\. Loading the Existing Ubuntu Development Environment

It is recommended that beginners use the virtual machine environment built by Forlinx directly. After understanding this chapter, you can directly jump to the compilation chapter for further study.

The development environment provided is: forlinx (username), forlinx (password).

There are two ways to use a virtual machine environment in VMware: one is to directly load an existing environment, and the other is to create a new environment. Let's first talk about how to load an existing environment.

First, download the development environment provided by Forlinx. In the development environment documentation, there should be an MD5 checksum file. After downloading the development environment, you should verify the integrity of the compressed package using the MD5 checksum. (You can use an on-line MD5 checksum tool or download a specific MD5 checksum tool for this purpose). To check if the checksum in the verification file matches the checksum of the file itself. If they match, the file download is successful. If they don't match, it suggests that the file may be corrupt, and you should consider downloading it again.

Select all compressed files and right-click to extract them to Nuvoton Ubuntu 20.04, as shown in the following figure:

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790824390-7eae1b4b-6fbe-40af-ae12-a5c82c76742d.jpg)

The MA35 Standard Environment folder appears after the decompression is complete, where .vmx is the file to be opened by the virtual machine.

**Basic Settings:**

Make most of the system settings in the location shown below. A lot of the setup requirements on Ubuntu can be done here.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790829796-4a5375c4-ad9f-4eea-abca-8dd8e9100aec.jpg)

#### 3.1.4 Ubuntu Network Settings

**NAT Mode**

Before using the network, make sure that our virtual machine can connect to the Internet, open the virtual machine settings, and change the network bridge mode in the network adapter to ‚ÄúNAT mode‚Äù:

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790829987-18652420-2497-424f-8174-dbc3f381b047.jpg)

When the VMware virtual NIC is set to NAT mode in a virtual machine, the network in the Ubuntu environment can be set to dynamic IP. The virtual NAT device and the host NIC are connected to communicate for Internet access in this mode. This is the most common way for our VM to get on the extranet.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790830080-7f1e10d6-053f-4fd2-acd3-1c4c197a689e.jpg)

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790830190-094e5261-4c9b-459b-99c0-94874e453dc5.jpg)

The network is set to dynamic IP.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790830491-d7b932e4-851c-41ec-943e-0a813f05ce36.jpg)

**Bridge Mode:**

If TFTP, SFTP and other servers are used, the network contact mode of the virtual machine needs to be set as the bridge mode. When the VMware virtual NIC is set to bridge mode, the host NIC and the VM NIC communicate via a virtual bridge, which requires the Ubuntu IP to be set to the same network segment as the host IP.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790830724-3781a417-17b9-4452-b8f7-2d5da104e004.jpg)

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790830863-a0f2a24f-af97-4180-b548-2f62be6fa873.jpg)

Set up static ip, at this time Ubuntu's IP and the host IP need to be set in the same network segment.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790831068-0eaf6bc8-b53f-42a3-b43e-a27eb996c6fb.jpg)

**Note: The IP and DNS involved in the network settings section should be set according to the user's own actual environment, the manual is an example.**

#### 3.1.5 U Disk Loading

Open VM Settings, USB Controller, select USB 3.0 in Compatibility and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. As shown in the picture below, since most computers nowadays support USB3.0 ports, if we don't set it up, when we plug in the USB3.0 port, we can't connect to the virtual machine. The principle is as follows:

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790831184-fc3d63d1-144b-49ea-9393-ddce8a5d3950.jpg)

After the virtual machine boot, insert the U disk, the virtual machine will be more in the lower right corner of the icon similar to the "U disk", right-click --> connect, and then you can see in the file system to see more than a directory, that the U disk loaded successfully, as shown in the figure:

#### 3.1.6 Virtual Machine Basic Library Installation

Before development, there are some other necessary libraries, we use the following commands to install them one by one, before installation, you need to ensure that the network can be used normally, you can get on the extranet:

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update                        // Update the download source information
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential            // Provide a list of software packages necessary for compiling programs
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install libncurses*               // Used to generate text-based user interfaces
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install lzop                     // A compression and decompression tool based on the Lzo library
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install net-tools                 // Network configuration tools
```

#### 3.1.7 Installation of Necessary Libraries for Compiling OKMA35 Linux Source Code

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update                                       //Update apt-get download sources
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server vim git fakeroot           //Installation of essential toolkits
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install git ssh make gcc libssl-dev liblz4-tool expect g++ patchelf chrpath gawk texinfo chrpath diffstat binfmt-support qemu-user-static live-build bison flex fakeroot cmake gcc-multilib g++-multilib unzip device-tree-compiler python3-pip libncurses5-dev
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev  libmpc-dev libicu-dev bsdmainutils expect
```

These library files are the ones that need to be downloaded when compiling the Linux source code by building the MA35 Linux compilation environment by yourself. If you are not building the MA35 Linux development environment, you can skip this step.

## 4\. Linux Compilation

This chapter mainly describes the compiling method of the source code related to the development board, including the kernel source code compilation and the application program compilation.

### 4.1 Preparation Before Compilation

### 4.1.1 Description of the Environment

+ Development environment OS: Ubuntu20.04 64-bit version
+ Cross-toolchain: aarch64-nuvoton-linux-gnu-gcc
+ The board uses the Bootloader version: u-boot-2020.07.
+ Development Board Kernel: Linux-5.10.140
+ Development board porting QT version: qt5.12.8

### 4.1.2 Source Code Copy

Source Code: OK-MA35-S21 \_Linux6.1.33+Qt5.12.8\_User Profile\\2-Image and Source Code\\1-Source Code\\ OKMA35\_Linux\_SDK.tar.bz2.00

Create a working directory

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ mkdir -p /home/forlinx/MA35                       //Create the working directory in order
```

Copy the source code file OKMA35\_Linux\_SDK.tar.bz2.00 in the user data to the/home/forlinx/ MA35 directory of the virtual machine.

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu:~$ cd /home/forlinx/MA35                //Switch to the working directory
forlinx@ubuntu:~/MA35$ cat OKMA35-linux-sdk.tar.bz2.0* > OKMA35-linux-sdk.tar.bz2
forlinx@ubuntu:~/MA35$ tar -xvf OKMA35-linux-sdk.tar.bz2             //Decompress the compressed package in the natural location
```

Just run the command and wait for it to complete.

#### 4.1.3 Configuration of the Cross-compiler

Copy OK-MA35-S21 \_ Linux 5.10.140 + Qt5.12.8 \_ User Profile\\ 3-Tools \\ aarch64-nuvoton-linux-gnu \_ sdk-build root \_ installer to the virtual machine ~ directory, and enter this directory.

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu: ~/$ chmod 777 aarch64-nuvoton-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot_installer
forlinx@ubuntu: ~/$ sudo ./aarch64-nuvoton-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot_installer
forlinx@ubuntu: ~/$ source /opt/aarch64-nuvoton-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot/environment-setup
```

### 4.2 Source Code Compilation

**Note:**

+ **After the kernel source code is decompressed for the first time, the source code needs to be compiled as a whole;**
+ **After compiling as a whole, you can compile separately according to the actual situation;**
+ **The source code compilation requires a development environment with a running memory of 8G or above. Please do not modify the VM virtual machine image configuration provided by us.**

#### 4.2.1 Full Compilation Test

Switch to the extracted source code path at the terminal:

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu:~$ cd  ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk/  
```

The following operations need to be done in the source directory:

**Note: For the first compilation, you need to configure the cross-compilation tool chain in Section 4.1.3**

If the memory capacity is 1G:

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  all 1g  
```

If the memory capacity is 512M:

```plain
 forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  all 512m  
```

The final compilation effect is shown in the following figure (the path may be different according to the actual situation):

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790834838-3159ebbf-0664-4548-a512-d26a606e56b4.jpg)

After successful compilation, the corresponding compilation project result file will be generated in the OKMA35-linux-sdk/images folder, and the image file will be found.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpg/50461850/1733790834914-cd02399e-ccb2-4431-86d1-0174106aebb1.jpg)

**Note: pack-image-OKMA35-S2\_emmc-sdcard.bin is used for USB full flashing, other files are used for single-step flashing.**

#### 4.2.2 Individual Compilation Tests

Compile Uboot Separately:

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35_Linux_SDK$./build.sh  uboot 1g/512m     //Generate u-boot.binÔºåpath/OKMA35-linux-sdk/images/  
```

Compile the kernel separately:

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh kernel 1g/512m       //Generate ImageÂíåImage.dtbÔºåpath/OKMA35-linux-sdk/images/  
```

Compile the apps separately

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  apps   //Generate a forlinx application that is automatically installed on the file system
```

Compile rootfs separately

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  rootfs      
```

#### 4.2.3 Clearance of Files Generated by the Compilation

The user performs the operation in the kernel source code path.

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  clean
```

This operation clears all intermediate files. However, it does not affect the source file, including the source file that has been changed, and the path may be different according to the actual situation.

Clear the kernel separately:

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  clean_kernel  
```

Clear Uboot separatelyÔºö

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk$./build.sh  clean_uboot  
```

### 4.3 Application Compilation and Operation

#### 4.3.1 Command Line Application Compilation and Operation

This subsection uses the watchdog test program, the default program in the OKMA35-linux- sdk/app/forlinx/forlinx\_cmd/fltest\_watchdog.

1\. Use the cd command to enter the directory /home/forlinx/ MA35

```plain
  forlinx@ubuntu:~$  cd /home/forlinx/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk/app/forlinx/forlinx_cmd/fltest_watchdog  
```

2\. Add the cross-compiler path and use make to cross-compile.

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk/app/forlinx/forlinx_cmd/fltest_watchdog$ source /opt/aarch64-nuvoton-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot/environment-setup
ÔºàIf the following content pops up, the setting is successfulÔºâ
_           _ _     _                 _
| |__  _   _(_) | __| |_ __ ___   ___ | |_
| '_ \| | | | | |/ _` | '__/ _ \ / _ \| __|
| |_) | |_| | | | (_| | | | (_) | (_) | |_
|_.__/ \__,_|_|_|\__,_|_|  \___/ \___/ \__|

       Making embedded Linux easy!

Some tips:
* PATH now contains the SDK utilities
* Standard autotools variables (CC, LD, CFLAGS) are exported
* Kernel compilation variables (ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE, KERNELDIR) are exported
* To configure do "./configure $CONFIGURE_FLAGS" or use
  the "configure" alias
* To build CMake-based projects, use the "cmake" alias
```

3\. Use make to cross-compile.

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu: ~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk/app/forlinx/forlinx_cmd/fltest_watchdog$ make	
aarch64-linux-gcc watchdog.c -o fltest_watchdog  
generate fltest_watchdog success!!!
```

Use the file command to view the generated file information

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu:~/MA35/OKMA35-linux-sdk/app/forlinx/forlinx_cmd/fltest_watchdog$ 
file fltest_watchdog 
fltest_watchdog: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1, for GNU/Linux 5.10.0, not stripped
```

From the result, you can see that the compiled 64-bit ARM file.
