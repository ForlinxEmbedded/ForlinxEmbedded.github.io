### 2.5 Screen Switching

OK3506J-S/OK3506J-C supports MIPI DSI and RGB screen interfaces, and can only support display on one screen. Currently there are two methods for controlling screen switching: Specify through the device tree in the kernel and dynamically control through the Uboot menu.

#### 2.5.1 Dynamic Control of Uboot Menu

The solution is based on the existing screen support system and does not require recompilation of code or flashing to achieve the screen switching function.

During the uboot self-boot process, press the space bar at the serial terminal to bring up the control options:

```plain
Hit key to stop autoboot('Spacebar'):  0 
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display type:mipi 
---------------------------------------------
```

Enter 2 in the terminal to switch screens. Refer to 3.2.29 Uboot Menu

#### 2.5.2 Kernel Device Tree Specification

This method does not require the connection of a serial terminal, and the system image defaults to the desired configuration selection, which is suitable for mass production. However, you need to modify the device tree and regenerate the system image once again.

**Note: This method has higher priority than the uboot screen selection, and the uboot selection will not take effect after the device tree is modified.**

<font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">Device tree path: kernel/arch/arm/boot/dts/OK3506-S-common.dtsi </font>

In the kernel source code, open the device dtsi file and find the forlinx-control node as follows:

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_Linux6_1_99_User_Manual/1735267237067_055b5f5b_9a27_4bba_9e6e_25c8d373b549.png)

The node has a default disabled state and needs to be changed to an okay enabled node. Change according to screen requirements.

**Parameter Description:**

| **Parameter**| **Meaning**
|:----------|:----------
| <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">status</font>| Describe the node state: disabled is for off, okay is for on
| <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">disp\_type</font>| Specify the mipi or lvds screen display.

Settings can be changed as needed, and after saving, recompilation is required to generate the image.

**Examples**:

Use the RGB screen display.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_Linux6_1_99_User_Manual/1735267291478_382e2a8e_cdb8_4837_abfc_f679a91eae4c.png)

After saving, recompile to generate the image.

### <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">2.6 System Shutdown</font>

In general, you can simply turn off the power. However, if you‚Äôre working with data storage or using specific functions, avoid unplugging the power to prevent potential irreversible file damage. To ensure the data is completely written, enter the sync command to synchronize the data before turning off the power.

**Note: For products designed based on the SoM, if there are scenarios where accidental power loss causes the system to shut down unexpectedly, measures such as adding power-loss protection can be incorporated into the design.**

## 3\. QT Platform Function Test

OK3506J-S/OK3506J-C platform 512 + 8G configuration (EMMC version) supports QT 5.15.11, and some QT applications are built in for testing.

Before the test, please configure the corresponding screen through the uboot menu, and execute to close the lvgl application that starts by default after starting the machine.

### 4.5 Watchdog Test

Watchdog is a function often used in embedded systems. The device node of watchdog in OK3506-S/OK3506-C is /dev/watchdog.

Start the watchdog, set the reset time for 10s, and feed the dog regularly. The system will not restart.

```plain
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# fltest_watchdog -t 10 -c
Watchdog Ticking Away!
```

When using ctrl+c to end the test program, kicking the dog is stopped, the watchdog is on, and the system is reset after 10s.

If you do not want to reset, enter the shutdown watchdog command within 10s after finishing the program:

```plain
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# fltest_watchdog -d
Watchdog disabled.
```

Start the watchdog, set the reset time for 10s, but do not feed the dog, the system will restart after 10 seconds.

```plain
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# fltest_watchdog -t 10
Watchdog Ticking Away!
[   39.114587] watchdog: watchdog0: watchdog did not stop!
```

### 4.6 RTC Function Test

<font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">Note: Make sure that the coin cell battery has been installed on the board and that the battery voltage is normal.

RTC test: The main way to set the software and hardware time is by using the date and hwclock utilities. When performing the board power-down and power-up test, the software clock reads whether the RTC clock is synchronized or not.

Time setting

```plain
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# date -s "2022-12-12 17:23:00"	//Set software time
Mon Dec 12 17:23:00 UTC 2022
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# hwclock -w											//Synchronize software time to hardware time
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# hwclock -r											//Display hardware time
Mon Dec 12 17:23:23 2022  0.000000 seconds
```

<font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">Then power down and power up the board, enter the system, and read the system time. After that, we can see that the time has synchronized.</font>

```plain
root@ok3506-buildroot:/# date
Mon Dec 12 17:26:10 UTC 2022
```

### 4.14 Ethernet Configuration

The OK3506 - S/OK3506 - C boards are equipped with two 100 - Mbps network cards. The default configuration for eth0 at the factory is static IP 192.168.0.232.

The path to the configuration file is: /etc/network/interfaces.

**Note: Since the root file system in the NAND configuration is read - only, the default IP cannot be modified by editing the configuration file. It can only be modified by manually executing commands.**

The configuration file for setting a dynamic IP is:

```plain
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

Set a static IP configuration. The following takes setting the IP of eth0 to 192.168.0.232 as an example:

```plain
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.232
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.0.1
```

| **Parameter**| **Meaning**
|:----------:|:----------
| <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">iface</font>| Used to specify a network card that requires a fixed IP.
| <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">address</font>| Used to specify an IP address that needs to be fixed.
| <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">netmask</font>| Used to set the subnet mask.
| <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">gateway</font>| Used to specify a gateway.

After setting up, use the sync file synchronization command to reboot the development board or restart the service for the configuration to take effect.

#### 5.1.2 OTG Full Burning Test

##### 5.1.2.1 RKDevTool Flashing Test

Path: User Information \\ Software Information \\ 3-Tools \\ \\RKDevTool\_v3.32\_for\_window.zip.

It is a development tool provided by Rockchip. Before use, please unzip it to a directory with an all English path. Connect the development board to the host using a Type-C cable. Press and hold the recovery key on the development board without releasing it, then press the reset key to reset the system. Release the recovery key approximately two seconds later. The Rockchip development tool will prompt the discovery of the loader device. There will be prompts on the Rockchip development tool : loader device found

**Note: The operation of the identification device is that the recovery button is pressed when the development board is powered on. Theoretically, Rockchip development tools have no requirements for the unzip directory. However, some users have feedback that the unzip directory should be in full English. If the tool doesn't match the following figure, please consider unzipping it in an English directory.**

Open the Rockchip development tool:

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_Linux6_1_99_User_Manual/1735267787698_646f1b57_da67_431b_b28c_ad14f616217a.png)

Click the "Upgrade Firmware" tab, click the "Firmware" button to select the full upgrade image update.img.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_Linux6_1_99_User_Manual/1735267965892_2e0b0d71_79d8_463f_b66a_0f429fabe1a1.png)

Click the "Upgrade" button to upgrade.

**Introduction to MASKROM mode**

If the loader is damaged and cannot enter the Loader mode, press and hold the red Maskrom key and then press the reset key to enter the maskrom mode for flashing.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_Linux6_1_99_User_Manual/1735268040103_4347a6c1_4838_4159_a130_c2190284c7e2.png)

At this time, the system will prompt the discovery of a maskrom device. The flashing process is consistent with the loader mode, so it is best to use an update.img burning.

Note: Don't click "Device Partition Table" in maskrom mode, it is invalid.

Note: A separate burn in maskrom mode will not clear the UBOOT environment variables.

##### 5.1.2.2 Factory Tool Flashing Test

Factory Tool is a factory batch OTG flashing tool, which does not need to read the image and supports large file flashing. Use this tool if RKDevTool is not compatible. Before use, you need to decompress to the full English path, connect the development board to the host, press the recovery key, press the reset key to reset, and release the recovery key after two seconds. There will be prompts on the Rockchip development tool : loader device found

Note: The operation of the identification device is that the recovery button is pressed when the development board is powered on.

**<font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">** Note: Theoretically, Rockchip development tools have no requirements for the unzip directory. However, some users have feedback that the unzip directory should be in full English. If the tool doesn't match the following figure, please consider unzipping it in an English directory.

#### 5.1.3 OTG Step Programming Test

In the development phase, it is very time-consuming to burn all of them every time, so here is the method of using OTG burning tool to burn in separate partitions.

**Note: The operation of the identification device is that the recovery button is pressed when the development board is powered on.**

First, after the compilation is complete, a separate partition image can be found in the rockdev directory.

Take separate flashing boot. img (including device tree and startup logo) as an example to show the flashing method.

Use the Type-C cable to connect the development board to the host. Press and hold the recover key and do not release it. Then press the reset key to reset the system. Release the recover key after about two seconds. The system will prompt to discover the loader device.

Click the "Device Partition Table" button, which will automatically read the partition address, and prompt you to update the download address, click "Yes", will be reported to read the partition table successfully, click on the partition of the right test area to select the partition image, and check the partition.
