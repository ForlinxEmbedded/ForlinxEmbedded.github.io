### 1.1 CPU/GPU/NPU Frequency Description

**RK3588J industrial grade SoM frequencies are described below:**

**Note: For the industrial-grade RK3588J SoM, to better test the maximum performance of this SOC, starting from version R4 and subsequent versions, the SoM in the user materials will default to operate in overclocking mode (Without performance requirements, it is recommended to modify it to the normal mode).**

Refer to ‚ÄúRockchip RK3588J Datasheet V1.1-03/08/2023.pdf ‚Äù

Table 3-2 Recommended operating conditions

| Maximum CPU A76 frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 1.6GHz
|----------|----------
| Maximum CPU A76 frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 2.0GHz
| Maximum CPU A55 frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 1.3GHz
| Maximum CPU A55 frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 1.7GHz
| Maximum GPU frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 700MHz
| Maximum GPU frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 850MHz
| Maximum NPU frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 800MHz
| Maximum NPU frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 950MHz

‚ë† Normal mode indicates that the chip is operating at a safe voltage and frequency; For industrial environments, it is highly recommended to keep it in normal mode to reasonably ensure longevity.

‚ë°Overclocking mode will bring higher frequency, and the corresponding voltage will also increase. When running in overclocking mode for a long time, the life of the chip may be shortened, especially in high temperature conditions.

To switch to "normal mode", you need to add # include "rk3588j.dtsi" to the reference in the kernel device tree. The path is:

## 2\. Fast Startup

### **2.1 Preparation Before Startup**

+ 12V2A or 12V3A DC Power Cable
+ Debugging serial cable                                                                                         

The debug serial port on the development board is a Type-C socket, allowing connecting the development board to a PC using a USB to Type-C cable to monitor the status of the development board.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940829853_11e7dc47_93fa_44b4_84f9_15099a646a85.jpeg)

### **2.2 Debugging Serial Driver Installation**

The debugging serial port of the OK3588 - C platform uses a Type - C interface. There is an on - board USB to UART chip, so there's no need to purchase a USB to serial port debugging tool. It is extremely simple and convenient to use.

To install the driver, please use the driver package DriverAssitant \_ v5.13.zip provided in the 3-tool directory.

Run DriverInstall.exe directly after the unzipping is completed; in order to ensure the driver is the latest version, please unstall the driver first, then install again.

### **2.3 Serial Port Login**

#### 2.3.1 Serial Port Connection Settings

 **Description:**

+ **Serial port terminal login user: serial port terminal automatically logs in root user without password;**
+ **Serial port settings: baud rate 115200, data bit 8, stop bit 1, no parity bit, no flow control;**
+ **Hardware Requirements: Type-C cable required to connect PC and development boards;**
+ **Software requirements: PC Windows system needs to install the super terminal software. Because the terminal software has many types, users can choose their familiar one.**

In the following, we take the putty terminal software as an example to introduce the serial port login method:

Step 1: Connect the serial port number of the computer---check the serial port number from the device manager (Based on the port actually recognized by the computer );

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940830154_f1183938_03bf_4ed0_b9c1_61c3cb36999d.png)

Step 2: Open and set up putty, then set the‚Äú line according to the COM port of the computer used, baud rate 115200;

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940830351_944c8fb8_def2_4746_9449_2cd8763908a1.png)

Step 3: After the setting, input the COM port used by the computer in Saved Sessions. The following figure takes COM3 as an example, save the settings, open the serial port again later, and click on the saved port number;

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940830538_2553e7fc_b6d5_434b_ace7_7864de173fe8.png)

#### 2.3.2 Serial Login

After the terminal software on the PC side is set, connect the PC and the development board through the serial port cable, and power on after connecting the power supply. The startup information can be seen through the terminal software.

The following startup message indicates a successful start, allowing a new command line to be entered by pressing Enter:

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940830731_94ee0055_dc57_46dc_a75b_940b5d86a20a.png)

### **2.4 Screen Switching**

OK3588 supports various screen interfaces such as MIPI DSI, HDMI, eDP, DP, RGB, etc., and can simultaneously perform mirroring and independent display for up to four screens. Currently there are three screen switching methods: uboot menu dynamic control; kernel device tree designation; DisplayHwConfig application control.

OK3588 contains 4 display controllers, i.e. 4 VP. It supports up to 4 screens simultaneously. The maximum resolution of VP0 is 7680x4320; the maximum resolution of VP1 is 4096x4320; the maximum resolution of VP2 is 4096x4320; the maximum resolution of VP3 is 2048x1080.

#### 2.4.1 Dynamic Control of Uboot Menu

##### 2.4.1.1 Display Type Settings

This method allows switching without recompiling and burn-in of existing supported screens.

During the uboot self-boot process, press the space bar at the serial terminal to bring up the control options:

```bash
Hit key to stop autoboot('Spacebar'):  0
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display type
---------------------------------------------
```

Enter 2 at the terminal to access the Screen Control sub-menu:

```bash
---------------------------------------------
hdmi0 and edp0 share same port, only one can be used.
hdmi1 and edp1 share same port, only one can be used.
only four VPs internally, so up to four interfaces can be activated
hdmi edp dp can only be displayed on VP0 or VP1 or VP2.
dsi0 dsi1 can only be displayed on VP2 or  VP3.
rgb can only be displayed on VP3.

Select  display
  0:Exit
  1: hdmi0 => VP0
  2: hdmi1 =>
  3: edp0  =>
  4: edp1  =>
  5: dp0   =>
  6: dp1   =>
  7: mipi0 =>
  8: mipi1 =>
  9: rgb   =>
  a: primary display  => HDMI0
b: primary display resolution => 1920x1080p50
---------------------------------------------
```

According to the content of the comments in the uboot menu, you can get the uboot display menu setting rules:

1\. Both hdmi0 and edp0 use the same port, and only one of them can be used at the same time;

2\. HDMI1 and EDP1 share the same port, and only one of them can be used at a time;

3\. There are only four VP internally, so a maximum of four interfaces can be activated;

4\. HDMI, EDP, and DP can only be displayed on VP0, VP1, or VP2;

5\. DSI0 and DSI1 can only be displayed on VP2 or VP3;

6\. RGB can only be displayed on VP3.

When setting up the display, enter the serial number corresponding to the display interface and VP will be assigned to the corresponding interface. If you input again, the system will switch the available VP (Virtual Ports) for this port one by one, or close the VP assigned to this port.

Enter a to switch the main screen display. Only the interface assigned with VP can be set as the main screen display.

**Setup Examples**:

As shown in the figure below, VP is assigned to hdmi0, hdmi1, dp0 and mipi0, so the main screen display can be selected from one of the above four interfaces. Because the HDMI interface is used, the EDP interface cannot be used. The primary display also selects HDMI0 with VP0 assigned and sets the resolution to 1920x1080.

**Note: When the primary screen is HDMI or DP, you need to set the "primary display resolution" to 3840x2160 and connect the primary screen before the device is powered on. Otherwise, connecting the main screen after startup will result in resolution switching on the secondary screen. When the main screen is EDP or MIPI, the primary display resolution option will not take effect.**

```bash
---------------------------------------------
Select  display
  0:Exit
  1: hdmi0 => VP0
  2: hdmi1 => VP1
  3: edp0  =>
  4: edp1  =>
  5: dp0   => VP2
  6: dp1   =>
  7: mipi0 => VP3
  8: mipi1 =>
  9: rgb   =>
  a: primary display  => HDMI0
b: primary display resolution => 1920x1080p50
---------------------------------------------
```

#### 2.4.2 Kernel Device Tree Specification

This method does not require the connection of a serial terminal, and the system image defaults to the desired configuration selection, which is suitable for mass production. However, we need to manually modify the device tree and regenerate the system image once again

Note: This method has a higher priority than the screen selection in U-Boot and the DisplayHwConfig application. After modifying the device tree, the selection in U-Boot will not take effect.

Device tree path: kernel-6.1/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/OK3588-C-Common.dtsi

In the kernel source code, open the device dtsi file and find the following node:

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940830946_1935c571_9a4a_436b_abc6_ddbe18e07737.png)

The node has a default disabled state and needs to be changed to an okay enabled node. Change according to screen requirements.

**Parameter Description:**

| | **Meaning**
|----------|----------
| status| Describe the node state: disabled is for off, okay is for on
| HDMI0| Specify the VP assigned to HDMI0
| HDMI1| Specify the VP assigned to HDMI1
| EDP0| Specify the VP assigned to EDP0
| EDP1| Specify the VP assigned to EDP1
| DP0| Specify the VP assigned to DP0
| DP1| Specify the VP assigned to DP1
| MIPI0| Specify the VP assigned to MIPI0
| MIPI1| Specify the VP assigned to MIPI1
| RGB| Specify the VP assigned to RGB
| primary\_display| Specify the main screen display

Users need to change the setting parameters as required. After saving, it is necessary to recompile and generate an image.

An annotated description of the node:

1\. Both hdmi0 and edp0 use the same port, and only one of them can be used at the same time;

2\. HDMI1 and EDP1 share the same port, and only one of them can be used at a time;

3\. There are only four VP internally, so a maximum of four interfaces can be activated;

4\. HDMI, EDP, and DP can only be displayed on VP0, VP1, or VP2;

5\. DSI0 and DSI1 can only be displayed on VP2 or VP3;

6\. RGB can only be displayed on VP3.

So the optional parameters for HDMI0/1, EDP0/1, DP0/1 are "VP0", "VP1", "VP2", and "OFF";

MIPI0/1 optional parameters are: "VP2", "VP3";

The RGB optional parameter is: "VP3";

The primary\_display parameter depends on the actual display interface assigned to get the VP.

**Note: When modifying the device tree, you need to follow the annotation rules to avoid using conflicts. The driver does not detect whether the forlinx-control configuration conforms to the rules. An error in the setting will cause abnormal display. For the display interface set to "OFF", blocking, deleting, or retaining is possible. It‚Äôs not necessary to set all four VP.**

**Examples**:

Assign VP0 to HDMI0, VP1 to HDMI1, VP2 unused, and VP3 for RGB use. Set the main screen to HDMI0.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android 14_User_Manul/1718940831160_05a365a0_cb31_4721_8ec5_c7e9cdb3d04a.png)

After saving, recompile to generate the image.

### **2.5 System Shutdown**

In general, the power can be turned off directly. If there is data storage, function use, or other operations, avoid turning off the power arbitrarily during operation to prevent irreversible damage to the file. In such cases, only re-flashing the firmware can resolve the issue. To ensure that data is not completely written, enter the sync command to complete data synchronization before turning off the power.

Note: For products designed based on the SoM, if there are scenarios where accidental power loss causes the system to shut down unexpectedly, measures such as adding power-loss protection can be incorporated into the design.

If the automatic restart does not occur after removing the TF card, a manual restart can also complete the burning. Please be patient during the burning process.

## 5\. System OTA upgrade Test

OTA (over the air) upgrade is a standard software upgrade method provided by Android system. It has powerful functions, and the current version of system OTA upgrade provides two methods of local complete package upgrade and network upgrade.

### **5.1 OTA Upgrade Package Compilation**

You can use the build.sh in the OK3588 - android14 - source directory to compile the full OTA upgrade package. Please modify the Android code first, and then compile the OK3588 system upgrade package:

```bash
forlinx@ubuntu20:~/OK3588-android14-source$ ./build.sh -KAuop
```

The directories of the generated files are rockdev/Image - ok3588\_c/ and IMAGE/OK3588\_C\_USERDEBUG\_OK3588 - C - ANDROID\_\_xxxxxxxxxx/IMAGES/.

Among them, ok3588\_c - ota - eng.root.zip is the full upgrade package, and ok3588\_c - target\_files - eng.root.zip is the incremental upgrade package.   
Rename either ok3588\_c - ota - eng.root.zip or ok3588\_c - target\_files - eng.root.zip to update.zip, and it can be used for a full OTA upgrade.

**Note: The full upgrade package contains the complete system, while the incremental upgrade package contains the differences between two versions. Therefore, you need to ensure that the development board has been flashed with the lower - version system before using the incremental upgrade to ensure a correct upgrade.**

### **5.2 OTA Local Upgrade**

Copy the update.zip generated in the previous section to the root directory of the USB or TF card, or the /data/media/0/ directory, the system will automatically detect the upgrade package and pop up the upgrade dialogue box.

The following is done in adb mode:

```bash
adb root
adb remount
adb push updata.zip /data/media/0/
```

After waiting for a while, the interface prompts whether to install the upgrade package window.

Click "Yes".

Finally, you can verify that the android system has been modified.

Note: The prompt for firmware upgrade operation after the system reboot is the correct prompt because the file /data/media/0/update.zip exists, so it will wait for a few minutes to pop up the prompt. The Firmware Prompt dialog will not pop up after deleting the/data/media/0/update.zip.

### **5.3 OTA Network Upgrade**

1\. Environment Setup

Edit the device/rockchip/rk3588/ok3588\_c/ok3588\_c.mk file and modify the server IP address through ro.vendor.ota.host.

## 6\. Multi-display with Independent Touch Control

The multi-display with independent touch control function enables you to use the DisplayHwConfig app to set the main and secondary screens, the binding relationship between the display and VOP, the binding relationship between the display and touch (input) devices, customize the DPI settings, and display the app itself on different screens.

After the parameter settings are completed, restart the device for the settings to take effect.

The source code of the app is located in vendor/forlinx/DisplayHwConfig.

### **6.1 Primary and Secondary Screens Settings**

Click the ‚ÄúPRIMARY DISPLAY‚Äù button to specify the primary screen.

Select the display you want to set as the primary screen from the menu and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

Note: When setting the primary screen, make sure the selected display is bound to a VOP (Video Output Processor) and the relevant DTS (Device Tree Source) nodes are enabled. Otherwise, the Android system will indicate that the primary screen does not exist.

The currently opened display device, excluding the primary screen, is the secondary screen. The configuration of secondary screens is adaptive and does not require manual settings.

### **6.2 Binding between Display and VOP Settings**

Click the non - ‚ÄúPRIMARY DISPLAY‚Äù button to set the binding relationship between supported displays and VOP.

Click the button to enter the VOP selection page, and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù to save the changes.

**Note: The red text below shows the rules for binding VOP. Also, ensure that the same VOP is not bound to multiple devices.** 

### **6.3 Binding between Display and Touch (Input) Devices**

This function can dynamically bind the display and touch devices together to achieve the asynchronous touch function. The display information will be presented according to the binding relationship between the display and VOP. The drop - down menu shows the information of the current touch (input) devices. Select one and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù to establish the binding relationship.

The displayed information will be presented according to the binding relationship between the display and VOP. The drop - down menu shows the information of the current touch (input) devices. Select one of them and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù to establish the binding relationship.

The driver of the touch (input) device needs to support the phys parameter so that the app can obtain the information of the touch device.   
In the driver, the content of the phys parameter of the struct input\_dev structure needs to be added.   
You can refer to the following methods:

Add the input - phy attribute to the touch device node in the device tree and specify the content of phys.

```bash
ft5x06_dsi0: ft5x06@38 {
    compatible = "edt,edt-ft5406", "edt,edt-ft5x06";
    reg = <0x38>;
    pinctrl-names = "ft5x06_default";
    pinctrl-0 = <&ft5x06_dsi0_gpio>;
    interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
    interrupts = <RK_PC0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
    // irq-gpio = <&gpio3 RK_PC0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    // reset-gpio = <&gpio3 RK_PB7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    touchscreen-size-x = <1024>;
    touchscreen-size-y = <600>;
    input-phy = "ft5x06_2_38/input0";
    status = "okay";
    };
```

Add the content to obtain input - phy and configure phys in the touch device driver.

```bash
    const char *location;
    // 'input-phy(location)' is a crucial parameter for binding touch and display in the Android layer and must exist.
    // It is essential to ensure that the 'input-phy(location)' is unique for each device.
    of_property_read_string(client->dev.of_node, "input-phy", &location);
    if (location) {
        input->phys = location;
    }
```

Note: If you want to verify whether the multi - touch function is set correctly, each display device should display a different app, and then click on them respectively. You can also click the ‚ÄúDisplay on this screen‚Äù button to display the app on the specified screen and perform touch operations.

### **6.4 DPI Custom Settings **

For the main displays with different resolutions and sizes, the display effects are different even with the same DPI. Therefore, a function to customize the system DPI is provided.

Enter the specified DPI value in the ‚ÄúDisplay DPI‚Äù input box, then click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. The settings will take effect after restarting.

### **6.5 App Display on Different Screens**

By clicking the ‚ÄúDisplay on this screen‚Äù button, the app can be displayed on different displays.

## 7\. Root Permission Management

Root permission management is located in the ‚ÄúANDROID System Configuration‚Äù of the App DisplayHwConfig.
