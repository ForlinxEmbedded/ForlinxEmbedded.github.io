Usage scenario: After setting the screen to turn off automatically after a certain period in Weston’s configuration file, if you want to turn the screen back on, you need to touch the screen or move the mouse. If the screen is off and there is no physical mouse to move and wake it up, or if you want to remotely turn on the off - screen, you can use the evemu tool to record a mouse movement event to simulate the operation of a real physical mouse and wake up the screen. In this way, remote wake - up can be achieved.

The evemu tool is a utility for Linux systems, used to simulate, record, and process events of input devices (such as keyboards, mice, touchscreens, etc.). It is part of the libevdev library, allowing developers and system administrators to simulate input events without physical input devices or record input events from actual devices.

Go to the graphical configuration interface of the file system in the source code and select the evemu tool as “y”. Then re - compile the file system and burn rootfs.ext2 into the development board.

Use the “evemu - record” command to record a mouse movement operation, and use “evemu - play” to play back the recorded movement.

```shell
[root@ok3568:/]$ evemu-record  /dev/input/event1 > 2myevent
[root@ok3568:/]$ evemu-play /dev/input/event1 < 2myevent
```

Using the ‘evemu - play’ command can wake up the screen.
