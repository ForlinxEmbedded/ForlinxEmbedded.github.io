## 2\. Fast Startup

### 2.1 Preparation Before Startup

OK3576 development board has two system login modes: Serial login and hardware preparation before system startup:

+ 12V2A or 12V3A DC Power Cable
+ Debugging Serial Cable (Serial Login Use)

The debug serial port on the development board is a Type-C socket, allowing users to connect the development board to a PC using a USB to Type-C cable to monitor the status of the development board.

### 2.2 Debugging Serial Driver Installation

OK3576 platform utilizes a Type-C interface for the debug serial port (labeled DEBUG on the baseboard). It features an on-board USB-to-UART chip, eliminating the need for customers to purchase a USB-to-serial debug tool. The setup is extremely simple and convenient, but requires installation of the serial port driver. Functions such as Adb and flashing are realized through the Type-C interface (carrier board screen printing TypeC), and OTG related drivers need to be installed.

At this time, the system will prompt the discovery of a maskrom device. The flashing process is consistent with the loader mode, so it is best to use an update.img burning.

**Note: Don't click "Device Partition Table" in maskrom mode, it is invalid. A separate flash in maskrom mode will not clear the UBOOT environment variables.**

**Introduction to Downloading the Individual Image Function**

This feature is useful when you need to download a separate image. This function is only applicable in loader flashing mode.

Insert the TF card into the development board and start, the system will automatically enter the flashing process. When the flashing is complete, both the screen and the serial port will prompt:

Please remove SD CARD!!!, wait for reboot.

At this time, pull out the TF card, the system automatically restarts (please do not power down directly).

During mass production, check the flashing status by SoM heartbeat light.  Heartbeat light modes are as follows:

1\. Kernel startup phase: heartbeat light mode, regular intermittent blinking;

2\. Flashing preparation phase: EMMC indicator (off);

3\. Flashing phase:EMMC indicator (on);

4\. Flashing completion phase: Regular intermittent blinking.

If the automatic restart does not occur after removing the TF card, a manual restart can also complete the burning. Please be patient during the burning process.

## 5\. System OTA Upgrade Test

OTA (over the air) upgrade is a standard software upgrade method provided by Android system. It has powerful functions, and the current version of system OTA upgrade provides two methods of local complete package upgrade and network upgrade.

OTA upgrade package is divided into full upgrade package and incremental upgrade package. The full upgrade package is the complete system, and the incremental upgrade package is the difference package of V2.0 system relative to V1.0 system, which requires the device system to be V1.0 to use this incremental package to upgrade to V2.0.

Refer to the ‚ÄúOK3576-C\_Android14\_User‚Äôs Compilation Manual‚Äù for compilation.

**<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">OK3576-C 2GB memory version may fail due to insufficient memory, it is recommended that users appropriately trim system services.</font>**

### **5.1 OTA Upgrade**

Copy the compiled upgrade package to the root directory of USB, TF card, or /storage/emulated/0 directory, the system will automatically detect it and pop up the upgrade dialog box.

The following is done in adb mode:

```plain
adb root
adb remount
adb push ok3576_c-ota-eng.root.zip /storage/emulated/0/update.zip
```

After uploading the upgrade package using ADB, it is necessary to restart the development board to trigger the system to detect the upgrade package.
