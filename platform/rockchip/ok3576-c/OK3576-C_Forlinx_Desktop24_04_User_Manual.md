## 2\. Fast Startup

### 2.1 Preparation Before Startup

OK3576 development board has two system login modes: Serial login and hardware preparation before system startup:

+ 12V3A DC Power Cable
+ Debugging serial cable (Serial Login)

The debug serial port on the development board is a Type-C USB jack, so users can use a USB to Type-C cable to connect the development board to a PC and then check the board's status.

+ Screen: Connect the screen according to the development board interface (optional if display is not needed).

### 2.2 Debugging Serial Driver Installation

The debugging serial port of the OK3576-C - C platform uses a Type - C interface. There is an on - board USB to UART chip, so there's no need to purchase a USB to serial port debugging tool. It is extremely simple and convenient to use.

To install the driver, please use the driver package CP210x\_VCP\_Windows\_XP\_Vista.zip provided in the \\ 3-Tools \\ directory of the User Information.

Run CP210xVCPInstaller\_x64.exe directly after unzipping is complete, to ensure the latest driver is installed, please click driver uninstall first, then driver install.

### 2.3 Serial Login

#### 2.3.1 Serial Port Connection Settings

**Description:**

+ **Serial port settings: baud rate 115200, data bit 8, stop bit 1, no parity bit, no flow control;**
+ **Software requirements: PC Windows system needs to install the super terminal software. Because the terminal software has many types, you can choose your familiar one.**

In the following, take the putty terminal software as an example to introduce the serial port login method:

Step 1: Connect the serial port number of the computer---check the serial port number from the device manager (Based on the port actually recognized by the computer );

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/png/45535139/1726214204730-e2277f30-f460-4c2b-8965-b807e4ac62ef.png)

Step 2: Open and set up putty, then set the“ line according to the COM port of the computer used, baud rate 115200;

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/png/45535139/1726214204934-9bb8a98b-75fb-4a89-bba4-b1acbe4a0c5c.png)

Step 3: After the setting, input the COM port used by the computer in Saved Sessions. The following figure takes COM3 as an example, save the settings, open the serial port again later, and click on the saved port number;

Step 4: Turn on the development board's power switch. The serial port will print out the information output, including the username and password for Linux (no root privileges). If you need to use the root login, then the username and password are root and root, respectively.

```plain
input-event-daemon: Adding device: /dev/input/event9...
input-event-daemon: Start listening on 12 devices...
done
root@rk3576-buildroot:/# [   37.424104] vbus5v0_typec0: disabling
[   37.424151] vbus5v0_typec1: disabling
ok3576-buildroot login: forlinx
Password:
forlinx@ok3576-buildroot:~$ 
```

#### 2.3.2 Serial Login Common Problems

If the computer does not have a serial port, we can use the USB to serial cable to connect with the development board. ( Using a USB to serial cable connection requires the matching driver).

It is better to use a good quality cable to avoid error codes.

### 2.4 Screen Switching

OK3576 supports multiple screen interfaces such as MIPI DSI, HDMI, DP, etc., and can display three screens simultaneously or differently. There is one way to control screen switching: Uboot menu dynamic control.

OK3576 contains 3 display controllers, i.e. 3 VP. It supports up to 3 screens simultaneously. The maximum resolution of VP0 is 4K; the maximum resolution of VP1 is 2560x1600; the maximum resolution of VP2 is 1920x1080.

#### 2.5.1 Dynamic Control of Uboot Menu

##### **2.5.1.1 Display Type Setting**

This method switches screens without recompiling and flashing in existing supported screens.

When the board is powered on and started, press the ctrl + C button on the serial port terminal, the control options will pop up:

 As soon as the development board is powered on, press ctrl + C at the serial port terminal several times until the control option pops up.

```plain
Hit key to stop autoboot('CTRL+C'):  0
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display type
---------------------------------------------
```

Enter 2 at the terminal to access the Screen Control sub-menu:

```plain
---------------------------------------------
vp0==>off vp1==>off vp2=>off
Select  display
0:Exit
1:vp0 display off
2:vp1 display off
3:vp2 display off
---------------------------------------------
```

When setting up the display, enter the serial number corresponding to the display interface and VP will be assigned to the corresponding interface. If you input again, the system will switch the available VP (Virtual Ports) for this port one by one, or close the VP assigned to this port.

Here, take opening the HDMI screen as an example. When entering 1 on the terminal, "vp0 display HDMI" represents opening the HDMI screen.

```plain
Writing to mmc(0)... done
---------------------------------------------
vp0==>hdmi vp1==>off vp2=>off
Select  display
0:Exit
1:vp0 display hdmi
2:vp1 display off
3:vp2 display off
---------------------------------------------
```

If you want to open the MIPI screen and DP screen, enter the corresponding numbers 2 and 3.

```plain
---------------------------------------------
vp0==>hdmi vp1==>mipi vp2=>dp0
Select  display
0:Exit
1:vp0 display hdmi
2:vp1 display mipi
3:vp2 display dp0
---------------------------------------------
```

After setting up, enter 0 to exit the screen selection operation.

```plain
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display type
---------------------------------------------

```

Enter 1 again, reboot to restart the development board.

### 2.5 System Shutdown

In general, the power can be turned off directly. If there is data storage, function use, or other operations, avoid turning off the power arbitrarily during operation to prevent irreversible damage to the file. In such cases, only re-flashing the firmware can resolve the issue. To ensure that data is not completely written, enter the sync command to complete data synchronization before turning off the power.

### 4.5 UART Test

The schematic diagram of the OK3576 platform carrier board indicates the presence of UART0, UART4, UART5, and UART6, totaling 4 serial ports. UART0 is designated as the debug port, UART4 as the Bluetooth port, and UART5 and UART6 as 485 ports.

| **UART**| **Device Nodes**| **Description**
|:----------:|:----------:|----------
| UART0| | Debugging serial port cannot be used directly for this test.
| UART4| /dev/ttyS4| It is used for Bluetooth and is not separately pinned out and can’t be directly used for this test.
| UART5| /dev/ttyS5| RS485\_1
| UART6| /dev/ttyS6| RS485\_2

Testing will use two RS485 ports, UART5 and UART6. Before testing, ensure proper connection of the two RS485 interfaces: connect A to A and B to B. The two RS485 carrier board interfaces are as follows:

### 4.9 USB Mouse Test

Connect the USB mouse to the USB interface of the OK3576 platform and use the dmesg command, the serial terminal prints the following information:

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/50461850/1752624410666-cde5c787-464d-4b88-a517-22e933abc8b7.png)

At this time, the arrow cursor appears on the screen, the mouse can work normally.

### 4.10 USB3.0

OK3576 supports 1 x USB 2.0 interface. You can connect a USB mouse, USB keyboard, USB flash drive ,and other devices on any of the on-board USB HOST ports, and it supports hot-swapping of the above devices. Demonstration with a mounting USB flash drive, the current USB flash drive test support up to 32G, but no test for 32G or above.

The terminal prints information about the USB flash drive, and since many types of USB flash drives exist, the information displayed may vary:

1\. After the development board booting, connect the USB interface disk to the USB host interface of the development board. The default log print information is low, so there will be no print information. Use the dmesg command to view and get information about the USB flash drive.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/50461850/1752624410725-7e412a05-c27e-4429-80a8-d678be8c6441.png)

2\. Check the mount directory:

```plain
root@localhost:~# mount | grep "sda1"
/dev/sda1 on /run/media/sda1 type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=936,iocharset=utf8,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)
```

We can see the USB mount directory: /run/media/sda1

3\. View the contents of the U disk (sda1 is based on the actual USB flash drive partition name).

```plain
root@localhost:~# ls -l /run/media/sda1/

### 4.13 LCD Backlight Adjustment

Backlight level range (0--255), maximum level 255, 0 indicating turn off. After connecting the mipi screen on the mipi dsi0, power up and start. Enter the system and enter the following command in the terminal to perform the backlight test.

1\. View supported backlight models

```plain
root@localhost:/# ls /sys/class/backlight
backlight Display the currently supported backlight model |

```

The following is an example of dsi0

1\. View the current screen backlight value:

```plain
root@localhost:/# cat /sys/class/backlight/backlight/brightness
200                    //The current backlight value is 200

```

2\. Backlight is off:

```plain
 root@localhost:/# echo 0 > /sys/class/backlight/backlight/brightness
```

3\. LCD backlight is on:

```plain
root@localhost:/# echo 125 > /sys/class/backlight/backlight/brightness
```

### 4.14 RTC Test

**Note: Ensure button cell batteries are installed \& voltage is normal.**

RTC test: The main way to set the software and hardware time is by using the date and hwclock utilities. When performing the board power-down and power-up test, the software clock reads whether the RTC clock is synchronized or not.

Time setting

```plain
root@ok3576:/# date -s "2022-12-12 17:23:00"       // Set the software time
Mon Dec 12 17:23:00 UTC 2022
root@ok3576:/# hwclock -wu				        // Synchronize the software time to the hardware time
root@ok3576:/# hwclock -r					        // Display the hardware time
Mon Dec 12 17:23:26 2022  0.000000 seconds
```

Then power down and power up the board, enter the system, and read the system time. After that, we can see that the time has synchronized.

```plain
root@rk3576:/# date
Mon Dec 12 17:23:50 UTC 2022
```

### 4.15 Watchdog Test

Watchdog is a function often used in embedded systems. The device node of watchdog in OK3576 is /dev/watchdog. This test provides two test procedures, and the user selects one test according to the actual situation.

+ Start the watchdog, set the reset time to 10s, and kick the dog regularly.

If usingfltest\_watchdog, it turns on the watchdog and kick it, so the system does not reboot.

```plain
root@ok3576:/# fltest_watchdog
Watchdog Ticking Away!
```

When using ctrl+c to end the test program, kicking the dog is stopped, the watchdog is on, and the system is reset after 10s.

If you do not want to reset, enter the shutdown watchdog command within 10s after finishing the program:

```plain
root@ok3576:/# fltest_watchdog -d                                          //Turn off the watchdog
```

+ Start watchdog, set reset time 10s, do not kick the watchdog.

Execute the command fltest\_watchdogrestart, this command will turn on the watchdog but will not kick the watchdog and the system will reboot after 10s.

```plain
root@ok3576:/# fltest_watchdogrestart
```

### 4.16 Key Test

Use the fltest \_ keytest command line tool to test the keys. At present, the fltest \_ keytest supports the test of the four keys VOL + and VOL- on the carrier board, and the key codes are 115 and 114 respectively.

Execute the following command:

```plain
root@ok3576 :/# fltest_keytest
```

At this point, press the lift button in sequence, and the following can be output on the terminal:

```plain
key115 Presse                                                         // VOL+press
key115 Released                                                       // VOL+release
key114 Presse                                                         // VOL-press
key114 Released                                                       // VOL-release
```

### 4.17 UART485 Test

The schematic diagram of the OK3576 platform carrier board indicates the presence of UART0, UART4, UART5, and UART6, totaling 4 serial ports. UART0 is designated as the debug port, UART4 as the Bluetooth port, and UART5 and UART6 as 485 ports.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/50461850/1752624410803-60803011-d8f8-4d61-8348-4ed4b9232462.png)

Testing will use two RS485 ports, UART5 and UART6. Before testing, ensure proper connection of the two RS485 interfaces: connect A to A and B to B. The two RS485 carrier board interfaces are as follows:

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/50461850/1752624410870-60414dee-6ffb-403f-9503-5cb0e70dbcb2.png)

Use two terminals to log in to the board, one UART0 debug port and the other using SSH.

Debug terminal

```plain
Use two terminal sessions to log in to the development board. One session uses the UART0 debug port, and the other uses SSH to log in.

Debug terminal
```

SSH terminal

```plain
root@ok3576:~# cat /dev/ttyS6     // Receive data. You can receive data when data is sent from ttyS5.
123456

root@ok3576:~# echo 111111 > /dev/ttyS6     // Send data
```

### 4.18  WIFI Test

+ **The network environment is different, so please set it according to the actual situation when you do this experiment.**

OK3576 platform supports the AW-CM358 WIFI Bluetooth 2-in-1 module.

**Note: Currently, the AP and STA modes cannot be used simultaneously on the OK3576 development board. If you want to use the AP mode, please turn off the corresponding AP first according to the configuration method of the AT mode.**

#### 4.18.1 STA Mode

This mode is used as a station to connect to the wireless network. In the following test, the router uses WPA encryption, the connected wifi hotspot name is: forlinx-wlan, and the password is: fl03123102650. Due to the different network environments, users should set up according to the actual situation when conducting this test:

Execute OK3576 \_ sta. sh or enter directly.

```plain
nmcli dev wifi connect forlinx-wlan password fl03123102650 ifname wlan0
```

If the connection is successful, the following will be printed:

```plain
root@ok3576: OK3576_sta.sh
Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with '4277e39b-8043-483e-b1a2-968862d5850d'.
```

Turn off STA, that is, disconnect the current WiFi connection. You need to execute the following command.

```plain
nmcli device disconnect wlan0
```

#### 4.18.2 AP Mode

The connection in STA mode needs to be closed before using AP mode.

First use the nmcli show command to see which AP node is currently attached.

```plain
root@ok3576:/# nmcli device
DEVICE         TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION
eth0           ethernet  connected               Wired connection 1
wlan0          wifi      connected               forlinx-wlan
lo             loopback  connected (externally)  lo
uap0           wifi      disconnected            --
wfd0           wifi      disconnected            --
p2p-dev-uap0   wifi-p2p  disconnected            --
p2p-dev-wfd0   wifi-p2p  disconnected            --
p2p-dev-wlan0  wifi-p2p  disconnected            --
eth1           ethernet  unavailable             --
can0           can       unmanaged               --
can1           can       unmanaged               --

```

You can see that the currently connected node is forlinx-wlan. Turn off forlinx-wlan.

```plain
root@ok3576:/# nmcli connection delete forlinx-wlan
Connection 'forlinx-wlan' (4277e39b-8043-483e-b1a2-968862d5850d) successfully deleted.
```

Repeat until no AP is available.

Use the OK3576 \_ AP. sh to create an AP hotspot named OK3576-test-AP.

```plain
root@ok3576:/# OK3576_AP.sh
Error: unknown connection 'OK3576-test-AP'.
Error: cannot delete unknown connection(s): 'OK3576-test-AP'.
Warning: Extension MASQUERADE revision 0 not supported, missing kernel module?
iptables v1.8.10 (nf_tables):  CHAIN_ADD failed (No such file or directory): chain POSTROUTING
Chain 'MASQUERADE' does not exist. Switching iptables version...
update-alternatives: using /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy to provide /usr/sbin/iptables (iptables) in manual mode

Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/13)

```

The network provider here is eth0, and the you can modify the/usr/bin/OK3576 \_ AP. sh to change the relevant settings.

Note: This setting is static, so if the setting is successful, the development board will turn on the AP mode directly. However, this AP does not have a network, so if the you want to have a network AP every time he boots up, he needs to add the following command to the boot script.

```plain
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE`
```

For example, add to/etc/rcS. D/S11-wifibt. sh.

```plain
#!/bin/bash
insmod /data/mlan.ko
insmod /data/moal.ko cal_data_cfg=none fw_name=sdiouart8987_combo_v0.bin sta_namm
e=wlan cfg80211_wext=12
sleep 5
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

```

The network that automatically creates IP and uses eth0 can be realized every restart.

### 4.19 Bluetooth Test

The AW-CM358 module on the OK3576 carrier board integrates Bluetooth. This section demonstrates data transfer via Bluetooth between a cell phone and the development board. It can support Bluetooth up to 5.0. Note that before testing Bluetooth, you need to follow the instructions in the previous section “WiFi Test” to load the WiFi module and firmware.

When the development board is connected to the smartphone, it appears as a Bluetooth headset.

After successful connection, the files on the mobile phone can be shared to the development board through Bluetooth.

The received files are in the /tmp directory.

At the same time, we can also send the files on the development board to the mobile phone.

### 4.20 CAN Test

The OK3576-C platform has two CAN bus interfaces and connection methods: Connection of the H terminal of CAN to other CAN devices; connection of the L terminal of CAN to other CAN devices.

Short-circuit CAN0 and CAN1, as shown：

root@ok3576:/# ip link set can1 down

root@ok3576:/# ip link set can1 type can bitrate 1000000 sample-point 0.8 dbitrate 2000000 sample-point 0.8 fd on
```

Set the baud rate of the can0 and can1 devices to 500000

3\. Open the can device

```plain
root@ok3576:/#ip link set can0 up

root@ok3576:/# echo 4096 > /sys/class/net/can0/tx_queue_len

root@ok3576:/# ip link set can1 up

root@ok3576:/#echo 4096 > /sys/class/net/can1/tx_queue_len
```

4\. Client sending data; Server receiving data

The can0 device acts as a server (the server first executes the following command).

```plain
root@ok3576:/# candump can0&
```

can1 device as a client (client sends data)

```plain
root@ok3576:/# cansend can1 1F334455#1122334455667788
```

### 4.21 4G/5G

**Description:**

+ **When using the IoT card to test, the module firmware version needs to be confirmed, the low firmware version is not supported, and** EM05 **needs to be upgraded;**
+ **Some IoT cards require a dedicated account number and password when dialing, and users adjust the commands according to the situation;**
+ **The quectelCM --help command allows you to see the meaning of the relevant parameters;**
+ **For switching between 4G and 5G, it is necessary to use the S2 switch on the carrier board**

OK3576 supports 4G module EM05 and 5G module RM500U. Connect the 4G/5G module to the development board before powering on, insert the SIM card, and start the development board.

1\. After connecting the module and powering up the board and module, check the USB status through the lsusb command.

```plain
root@ok3576:/#lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 04b4:6500
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0000:3825

**Bus 001 Device 005: ID 2c7c:0125                            //EM05 VID and PID
```

View device node status under /dev

```plain
root@ok3576:/# ls /dev/ttyUSB*
/dev/ttyUSB0  /dev/ttyUSB1  /dev/ttyUSB2  /dev/ttyUSB3 
```

2\. After the equipment is successfully identified, the dial-up Internet access test can be conducted. fltest\_quectel.sh calls quectelCM, see /usr/bin/fltest\_quectel.sh for specific commands

```plain
root@ok3576:/# quectelCM &
```

#### 6.1.2 OTG Full Flashing Test

##### 6.1.2.1 RKDevTool Flashing Test

+ Path: OK3576-C (Linux) User Profile\\Linux\\Tool\\RKDevTool\_Release\_v3.31.zip

It is a development tool provided by Rockchip Micro. Unzip it to a full English path before use, connect the TYPE-C0 port of the development board and the host computer with a Type-C cable, press and hold the recovery key of the development board and don't release it, then press the reset key to reset the system, and release the recovery key after about two seconds. There will be prompts on the Rockchip development tool : loader device found

**Note: The condition for recognition is that the development board is powered up and the RECOVER key is in the pressed state. Theoretically, Rockchip development tools have no requirements for the unzip directory. However, some users have feedback that the unzip directory should be in full English. If the tool doesn't match the following figure, please consider unzipping it in an English directory. During OTG flashing, it is necessary to link the OTG cable to the typeC port of the board, as shown in the following figure:**

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750318796237-22e349ae-0114-48aa-9d91-8d325204fb91.png)

#### 6.1.3 OTG Step Programming Test

In the development phase, it is very time-consuming to burn all of them every time, so here is the method of using OTG burning tool to burn in separate partitions.

**Note: To recognize the device, the recovery button on the development board should be pressed down while the board is powered on.**

First, after the compilation is complete, a separate partition image can be found in the rockdev directory.

Take separate programming boot.img (including device tree and startup logo) as an example to demonstrate the programming method.

Use the Type-C cable to connect the development board to the host. Press and hold the recover key and do not release it. Then press the reset key to reset the system. Release the recover key after about two seconds. The system will prompt to discover the loader device.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750321145954-e538cc24-efea-42d3-ac79-f4dea297807d.png)

Click the "Device Partition Table" button to automatically read the partition address.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750321169101-0b9fd528-7444-4dfd-80bf-8a3667939d1e.png)

The prompt asks if you want to update the download address. Clicking "Yes" will result in a successful reading of the partition table.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750321192039-f765e1ab-4b15-4520-977d-a882316605d1.png)

Click the right test area of the partition to select the partition mirror, and check the partition.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750321827091-49476e2a-c84f-428e-864a-ef66d28f5e78.png)

Click the "Execute" button will automatically burn and restart.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750321680514-c4f87f44-cc37-4eea-9f59-8a19405c108f.png)

**Introduction to MASKROM mode**

If the loader is damaged and cannot enter the Loader mode, press and hold the Maskrom key (On the right side of the RTC batter) and then press the reset key to enter the maskrom mode for flashing.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/43555823/1750321945719-2ce43c88-a38d-42ca-9fc3-53eae15b4000.png)

At this time, the system will prompt the discovery of a maskrom device. The flashing process is consistent with the loader mode, so it is best to use an update.img burning.

**Note: Don't click "Device Partition Table" in maskrom mode, it is invalid.**

### 6.2 TF Card Flashing

TF card flashing and testing

**Note: The maximum capacity of the test TF card is 32G; using a TF card larger than 32G may cause the card to fail to write.**

Insert the TF card into the development board and start it, and the system will automatically enter the flashing process. After the programming is completed, the screen and serial port will prompt:

Please remove SD CARD!!!, wait for reboot.

At this time, pull out the TF card, the system automatically restarts (please do not power down directly).

When mass production, you can judge whether the burn-in is completed or not according to the heartbeat light of the core board, and the heartbeat light changes during the burn-in process are as follows:

1\. Kernel startup phase: heartbeat light mode, regular intermittent flashing;

2\. Flashing preparation phase: EMMC indicator (off);

3\. Flashing phase:EMMC indicator (on);

4\. Flashing completion phase: Regular intermittent blinking.

If the automatic restart does not occur after removing the TF card, a manual restart can also complete the burning. Please be patient during the burning process.
