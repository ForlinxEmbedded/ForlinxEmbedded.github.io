### 3.5 OK-MA35-S21 Carrier Board Description

**Note: The component UID with "\_DNP" mark in the diagram below represents it is not soldered by default. The schematic diagrams in this manual are only for interface description. When users conduct hardware design, please refer to the source file materials.**

#### 3.5.1 Carrier Board Power

It uses a 12V power adapter for the power supply, and the power connector is a DC005 socket. S1(dip switch) is the power switch, which moves according to the screen printing indication on the board. The rear of S1 has TVS for electrostatic protection, F1 for over-current protection, and D1 and F1 cooperate for anti-reverse connection protection.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794131888_ec74bbcb_bf0d_4a2f_9355_8b10ee93bda7.png)

VCC\_12V is stepped down to DCIN (5V) through U1. DCIN directly powers the SoM to ensure that it can be powered on first.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794131960_8176532c_7d48_4a3a_be43_dc3ca8f308a7.png)

DCIN (5V) outputs VCC\_5V in a controlled manner through U2. U2 is controlled by EXTP\_EN. After the SoM is powered on, U2 is turned on VCC\_5V powers some 5V - powered devices on the carrier board.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132029_dcc186be_4834_4397_8d5e_cf08597886b7.png)

VCC\_5V is stepped down to VCC\_3V3 through U6 to power all 3.3V - powered devices on the carrier board.

**Note:**

- **When designing independently, it is essential to ensure the power - on sequence of the power supply. Specifically, the EXTP\_EN output from the SoM should be used as the enable signal for the DCDC power supply of the carrier board, so as to ensure that the SoM is powered on first and the carrier board is powered on later;**

- **Refer to the corresponding chip manual for the component selection and external layout of the step-up and step-down chip to ensure a good power circuit.**

#### 3.5.2 Reset Button

K1 on the carrier board is the development board reset key. Pressing it can realize the whole board power off and reset.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132196_ffd9f850_368c_4f66_b3e6_51bfb4e5aa82.png)

**Note: When the nRESET pin is not used, please float it and do not pull it up or down.**

#### 3.5.3 BOOT Configuration

The carrier board uses an 8-bit DIP switch S2 to select the system boot mode. Please adjust the options before powering up the development board.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132394_da8a9b1c_caff_4f29_a454_2fce8327e41d.png)

**Boot mode:**

eMMC: The development board program starts from the on - board eMMC of the SoM.

TF: The development board uses a TF card to boot the system. You can use this method to flash an image to the TF card.

USB: Generally, it is used for OTG to download images. The development board is connected to the computer‚Äôs USB port via a USB Type - C adapter cable at the P11 interface. You can use the program on the computer to flash an image to the development board.

Secure is secure boot, which ensures the authenticity and integrity of the system image and prevents the execution of malicious or unauthorized software implanted in the system. Currently, this function is disabled by default.

**NoteÔºö**

- **PG0 - PG7 are pins related to startup. These pins are pulled down by default inside the CPU. Meanwhile, the PG0, PG2, PG6, and PG7 pins on the SoM are pulled up with 10K resistors;**

- **Currently, the secure boot function is disabled by default, and the system can be started from the eMMC when only powered on. Please handle the relevant pins on the carrier board according to the flashing and startup situations;**

- **Since these pins are related to startup, it is not recommended to use them as GPIO. If they need to be used as GPIO, pay attention to the pin levels to avoid affecting the startup items.**

#### 3.5.4 Debugging Serial Port

There are two debug serial ports on the SoM. UART0 is used for A35 debugging, and UART16 is used for M4 debugging.   
To facilitate users, the two debug serial ports are integrated into one USB interface using the USB - to - serial chip CH342F.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132475_74e8db05_515a_4360_92ce_2d840fe536d2.png)

To use the debug serial ports, first install the CH342F driver on your computer. The driver download links are: http://www.wch.cn/products/CH342.html

Then connect the P6 port of the development board to the computer‚Äôs USB port using a USB - to - Type - C cable. Two COM ports will be generated in the computer‚Äôs Device Manager. Among them, Port A is the A35 debug serial port, and Port B is the M4 debug serial port.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132566_d687cff5_0fab_4356_a0ba_d722cfba8859.jpg)

Open a debug terminal tool on the computer, such as Putty. Set the baud rate to 115200, the data bits to 8, no parity bit, and the stop bits to 1. Select the correct COM port, power on the development board, and you can see the debug serial port information.   
**NoteÔºö**

- **To facilitate later debugging, please lead out these debug serial ports when users design the carrier board by themselvesÔºõ**

- **The debug serial ports on the carrier board are designed to prevent electric leakage. It is recommended that users refer to this design.**

#### 3.5.5 TF Card

The TF Card on the development board uses the SD0 channel of the CPU.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132679_b3b36aae_b1ed_4145_af69_146e7e5bac1e.png)

**Note: It is strongly recommended to reserve pull - up resistors on the bus; otherwise, it may affect the flashing of the TF card. It is recommended to reserve a series resistor and a capacitor to ground for the SD0\_CLK pin. The capacitor is left un - soldered by default. Since the TF card is a hot - swappable device, ESD protection should be provided. SD signals must be length-matched.**

#### **3.5.6 USB OTG Interfaces**

The carrier board supports USB flashing. Currently, the development board circuit only supports the device mode. When using USB0, pay attention to the design reference of HSUSB0\_VBUSVLD on the development board. When OTG\_ID is high, USB0 functions as a device.   
If only USB0 is used as the HOST, pull the OTG \_ ID to GND, and the USB socket power supply VBUS pin needs to supply 5V power. In addition, HSUSB0 \_ VBUSVLD can be used as a common IO.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132759_8b193b8b_d533_4638_b72d_a89e5396c1d6.png)

**Note: Only the native USB0 of the SoM supports the USB programming system. USB data lines are required to make 90Œ© differential impedance. Please select the appropriate ESD device. The HSUSB0\_VBUSVLD needs to detect voltage to enable the USB function normally.**

#### 3.5.7 LCD Interface

The RGB 888 is led out from the development board through the FPC seat with 54pin and 0.5mm pitch (P23). The maximum resolution can reach 1920 \* 1080 @ 60fps. It is suitable for the Forlinx 7-inch LCD.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132828_3914eafa_311f_4bc8_bd2b_ed3ca4a0da03.png)

#### 3.5.8 LVDS Interface

LVDS is converted from RGB888, and only one of them can be used.   
The development board leads out the LVDS signals through a DVI - I (24 + 5 pins) socket and supports USB touch.

![Image](./images/OK-MA35-S21_User_Hardware_Manual/1733794132922_56d6b1a0_23dd_447e_bf2e_c6fd8ae032cc.png)

**Note: The data and clock of LVDS need to have equal lengths. Impedance requirements: 50Œ© for single - ended and 100Œ© for differential.**

#### 3.5.9 Ethernet Interface

There are 2 x Ethernet interfaces, P46 is gigabit and P1 is 100m.   
The Gigabit network port is connected to the PHY chip YT8521SH-CA (U31) via RGMII and is led out by an RJ45 socket (P46). The socket model is FC - H021LNL, which has a built - in isolation transformer.

**Note:**

- **The TX group and RX group of the RGMII signals need to have equal lengths within each group;**

- **The RGMII and MDIO/MDC have the same level, which can be configured by CFG\_LDO\[1:0];**


- **Special attention should be paid to several power supplies of YT8521SH - CA. Unstable voltage will cause the chip to malfunction;**


- **The analog differential lines of the network need to have a differential impedance of 100Œ©, and the equal - length requirement between groups should be ‚â§1000 mil;**


- **It is recommended to use at least a 4 - layer board design to ensure that the traces have a complete reference plane. Otherwise, network communication will fail;**


- **It is recommended to directly copy the schematic and PCB design of the development board for this part.**

## 4\. Hardware Design Guide

**1. I2C requirements** 

**- Multiple slave devices can be mounted on a set of I2C buses, please ensure that there are no address conflicts;**
**-A pull-up resistor needs to be added to the I2C bus, but do not use multiple resistors for pull-up;  **
**-Please pay attention to level matching between the I2C on the SoM and the I2C on the slave device.**

**2. VBAT pin processing  
When using the RTC function on the SoM, a 3.3V power supply must be provided at the VBAT pin, and this power supply can be maintained when it is powered off.**

**3. Power-up sequence  
It is strongly recommended that users use the EXTP\_EN output from the SoM as the power on enable when designing the carrier board, and strictly control the power on timing. Or it may have the following influences:   
¬∑Excessive current during the power on stage;  
¬∑The device cannot start;  
¬∑The worst-case scenario is irreversible damage to the processor.**

**4. The unused signal pins of the SoM can be left floating, but please make sure to connect all the GND pins;**

**5. Explanation on the Issue of pin IO Leakage**

Before the SoM is powered on, if there is a high - level in - flowing current on the signal pins of the SoM, it will cause electrical leakage to the SoM. The most obvious phenomenon is that the red indicator light on the SoM can be seen slightly lit. This will lead to an incorrect power - on sequence. The most typical case is serial port leakage. Therefore, the peripheral parts directly connected to the CPU need to be designed with anti - leakage measures.

**6. Requirements for the Startup - related Pins PG0 - PG7**

PG0 - PG7 are startup - related pins. These pins are pulled down by default inside the CPU. Meanwhile, on the SoM, the pins PG0, PG2, PG6, and PG7 are pulled up with a 10K resistor. By default, the secureboot function is disabled, and the system can be started from the eMMC when only power is supplied. Please handle the relevant pins on the carrier board according to the flashing and startup situations. In addition, these pins are not recommended to be used as GPIO because they are related to startup. If they are used as GPIO, pay attention to the pin level and do not affect the startup item.

**7. Debug Serial Port Hardware Design Instructions**

UART0 serves as the debug serial port for the A - core. To facilitate later debugging, it is recommended to lead it out and take proper anti - leakage measures. If the M - core is used, UART16\_TXD needs to be led out for debugging convenience.

**8. SD Card Hardware Design Requirements**

All signal lines of the SD card need to be pulled up to 3.3V through resistors. Otherwise, it may affect the SD card programming. For the SD0\_CLK pin, it is recommended to reserve a series resistor and a capacitor to ground, and the capacitor is left un - soldered by default.

**9. Requirements for the HSUSB0\_VBUSVLD Pin**

The D6\_PF15 pin is set to the HSUSB0\_VBUSVLD function by default. When USB0 is used as a device, this pin must be kept at a high level, such as during programming via USB0. If USB0 is used as a host, this pin can be used as a GPIO.

**10. T13\_PJ5 Pin Requirements**

The T13\_PJ5 pin needs to be pulled down with a 10K resistor. Pulling up this pin is prohibited, otherwise, it will affect the normal startup of the eMMC.

**11. RS485 Requirements**

When using RS485, it is recommended to select the RTS pin of the corresponding UART as the flow - control pin. The flow control has already been integrated at the driver layer. If a GPIO is selected, work needs to be done at the application layer.

**12. ADC/EADC Requirements**

The default input range of ADC0 - 7 and EADC0 - 7 is 0 - 3.3V. Attention should be paid to the input voltage range.

**13. PCB Layout Requirements for Self - Made Carrier Board**

To ensure the solder climbing yield of the stamp holes on the SoM, when manufacturing the stencil for the carrier below:, the opening area of the stamp holes is expanded to ensure the amount of solder paste, as shown in the gray part in the following figure. Therefore, when laying out the carrier board, it is necessary to ensure that the pads of other components are kept away from the enlarged area of the SoM stencil. Meanwhile, no holes are allowed to be drilled in the enlarged area of the SoM stencil to prevent solder leakage, which may affect the soldering quality.

**14. Surface Treatment Process Requirements for Self - Made Carrier Board PCB**

It is recommended to use the electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) process for the surface treatment of the carrier board. Since the SoM and the carrier board are connected by stamp holes + LGA, using the ENIG process can reduce the soldering difficulty after the carrier board is stored separately. It is strongly recommended to send the SoM and the SMD components on the carrier board to the pick - and - place machine for soldering simultaneously. If the carrier board has components on both sides, it is recommended that the side with the SoM pass through the reflow oven last to avoid the SoM passing through the oven twice on the baseboard.

**15. Stencil Requirements for Self - Made Carrier Board**

Inform the factory that the stencil for the SoM area does not need to be processed as the compensation has already been done, and other areas can be modified.   
e.g.:

**16. SoM Vibration - Resistance Requirements**

If the your product has vibration - resistance requirements, it is recommended to add a rigid connection between the area where the SoM is located and the housing to avoid deformation of the area where the SoM is located during vibration. This can prevent the solder joints from breaking due to stress fatigue, which could otherwise affect the stable operation of the product.
